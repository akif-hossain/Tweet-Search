This is an app to get familiar with Obj-C/iOS development.

Current functionality:
- Loading tweets
- Refreshing tweets using refresh button
- Cell reuse/background threads to load images/caching

Nice to have functionality (for further improvement):
- Refreshing tweets automatically/pulling down the table listview
- Adding custom search
